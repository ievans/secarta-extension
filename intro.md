# Preflight Beta

## To install the extension, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emaioeinhnifhcmlihcbooknbpjdbllb) or our [Mozilla Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/r2c-beta/).
## Your GitHub copilot.   
Preflight makes it fast and simple for you to make decisions about using npm packages. We surface data and a rubric for their quality and security, and if anything merits your attention, we alert you. You shouldn't have to needlessly read 3rd-party code and instead focus on the stuff that matters, like writing that killer new feature and shipping product.

If any of our checks come back with concerning answers we'll notify you through a modified GitHub UI, letting you investigate and focus on the stuff that's abnormal about a project.

## We are Open. 
We perform all of our development in the open. The code for this extension is publicly available on GitHub: github.com/returntocorp/secarta-extension

This extension requests access to read and modify www.github.com for the purposes of extending and augmenting GitHub's repo page. We do not store any sensitive identifying information or credentials on our servers.

## Beta Telemetry Collection.
This extension is in beta and contains a number of product experiments, so we collect telemetry from the extension to understand use and decide what to work on next. This telemetry contains a minimal amount of identifying information (your GitHub username, client IP address, and a unique installation ID that is local to your browser). If you have concerns about your privacy or how we use telemetry, please let us know!

We want your thoughts and ideas! Reach out to us via our Beta Slack room or via feedback@ret2.co üòç
